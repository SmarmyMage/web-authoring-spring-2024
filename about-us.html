            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">My name is Anthony Reyna, and I am from Dallas, Texas. I am currently studying web design at Dallas College, and hopefully get my associate's.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">I enjoy playing video games, watching internet videos, and talking to my friends. If you're curious on other things about me, check the FAQ page.</p>

            <h2>The Goal of This Web Page</h2>
            <h3 class="mb-3">Showcasing My Skills and Growth in Web Design</h3>
            <p class="mb-3">This webpage was created for my Web Authoring class. This class instructs us in designing and developing web pages in HTML, and using other web tools like Bootstrap and Javascript.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">With the creation of this web page, I hope to improve my web design skills further, and hoepfully use this to show my growth in those skills to those who are interested.</p>

            <h2>How Did We Get Here?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">When it comes to when I started web design, it was during my sophmore year of high school, in 2018. Much like this class, I took a web design class where we were tasked to create our own website.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">This was my first exposure to HTML and working with it, and I didn't really touch it until college.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">When I started my associate degree in web development in 2023, I interacted with HTML for the first time in years.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">What Web Authoring Has Taught Me</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">My web authoring class has shown me a lot of different ways to build an effective web page.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Things like grid layout, theme CSS pages, and implementing Javascript and Bootstrap into a web page. I have also relearned <br>
                alot of things, like using classes and ids, giving elements margin/padding, and resposive design.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">I was able to use the grid layout on the Products page, responsive design to layout the page for mobile use, implement Javascript for the nav bar for mobile, <br>
                and use Bootstrap to create the About Us and Register page.</p> 
            <p class="mb-3">Utilizing these tools has helped me better understand how to layout a web page and how to use open-source libraries to make neater wep pages.</p>

            <h2>Why Should You Care?</h2>
            <p class="mb-3">If you're looking through my page, you're most likely looking at my web design skills, and my growth in those skills.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">You might be in need of a website for your business or looking to create a personal portfolio,</p>
            <p class="mb-3">I hope that you're able to see what I am able to acomplish when it comes to web design.</p>
