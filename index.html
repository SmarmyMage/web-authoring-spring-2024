                <h2>My Schooling</h2>
                    <h3>My Reason For Taking This Class</h3>
                    <p>The reason I'm taking Web Authoring this semester is I am going through the Web Development program,
                        and it is a required class for the program.</p>
                    <p>This class will also help me reinforce the skills I've already learned the past semester.</p>
                    <h3>Other Classes I've Taken</h3>
                    <p>Some of the other classes I've taken are some of the general classes that is required; like Algebra and English.</p>
                    <p>Before going through the Web Dev program, I was in the Game Development program, and took classes 
                        related to game programming.</p>
